		<h1>How a Computer Works</h1>

		<p>When the power button is pressed, the machine goes through several internal processes before it's ready for you to use(booting). The booting process is controlled by the PC's basic input-output system embedded on the motherboard(BIOS). After the computer finishes booting, you can control it through an operating system(OS). Most non-Apple PCs run a version of Microsoft Windows or a Linux distribution. These operating systems are designed to run on various kinds of PC hardware, while Mac OS X is designed primarily for Apple hardware. The OS is responsible for breaking down the CPUâ€™s work into manageable chunks, coordinating the flow of data in and out of RAM, determining when to use virtual memory on the hard disk (to supplement an insufficient amount of RAM), managing where data/information should be stored, and provides an user interface (allows user to interact with the computer). The user can open different softwares installed on the computer to perform different functions (e.g. Microsoft Word allows users to input/edit/format/output text and images).</p>
		<h2>How components of a computer interact with each other </h2>
		<p>Input -> Processing->Output</p>
		<p>The computer receives data from input devices such as the mouse or keyboard, which 
		allows the user to manipulate the user interface of the computer's operating system. 
		Other input devices include the wireless network card, which receives information from 
		the web, the hard drive, or external drives like a flash drive.</p>
		<p>There are many things other than the CPU in a computer. Other pieces of hardware work 
		together with the CPU to manipulate data. The CPU 
		receives instructions from software and sends tasks it cannot perform to the other parts 
		of the computer like the hard drive, RAM,  and graphics processing unit(GPU). </p>
		<p>Finally, the computer needs a way to output the information it processes. The monitor 
		is the main output device to the user. Other output devices include printers, speakers, 
		and drives which store the output information</p>
