		<h1>How a Computer Works</h1>
		<p>When the power button is pressed, the machine goes through several internal processes before it's ready for you to use(booting). The booting process is controlled by the PC's basic input-output system embedded on the motherboard(BIOS). After the computer finishes booting, you can control it through an operating system(OS). Most non-Apple PCs run a version of Microsoft Windows or a Linux distribution. These operating systems are designed to run on various kinds of PC hardware, while Mac OS X is designed primarily for Apple hardware. The OS is responsible for breaking down the CPU’s work into manageable chunks, coordinating the flow of data in and out of RAM, determining when to use virtual memory on the hard disk (to supplement an insufficient amount of RAM), managing where data/information should be stored, and provides an user interface (allows user to interact with the computer). The user can open different softwares installed on the computer to perform different functions (e.g. Microsoft Word allows users to input/edit/format/output text and images).</p>
		<h2>How components of a computer interact with each other </h2>
		<p>Input devices -> Processing/Memory devices ->output devices</p>
		<p>When a mouse (input device) is clicked to open a program, a copy of the software program is transferred from the hard disk (storage device) into RAM (internal memory device used by the processing device) because what is currently required for processing by the CPU has to be in the temporary storage area, random access memory. 
		Data is inputted using the keyboard (input device), data is stored in RAM (internal memory device used by the processing device), and displayed on the VDU (output device) because data to be used by the CPU for processing needs to be in RAM, the temporary storage area.</p>
