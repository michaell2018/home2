		<p>A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, 
			and process data. Computers are complex as there are a lot of different components inside them, and they all serve
			different purposes. They all need to work together for the computer to work. The first mechanical computer was 
			invented in the 19th century by an English mathematics professor named Charles Babbage. In the 1820s, he worked on
			his 'Difference Engine' (a machine which could perform mathematical calculations) and it developed into what we 
			now know as a computer.</p>
